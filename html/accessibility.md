# Accessibility

When someone describes a site as "accessible", they mean that any user can use all its features and content, regardless of how the user accesses the web â€” even and especially users with physical or mental impairments.

## Why do you need to learn it?

Building accessible sites benefit everyone:

- Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
- Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
- Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
- It is the law in some places.
