# Studying

Guide that I use for studying web development. Please note that the topics that I listed below are the topics that I think are important when learning web development. You can use this as you like. I did not order the topics in particular order so feel free to check any topic that you like. Also, you do not need to learn all of this to be a good web developer, though I think having at least basic knowledge of the topics below will help you become a better web developer.

In order to study a topic effectively, I think you need to do the following for a particular topic:

1. Learn the basic definition.
1. Why do you need to learn it.
1. How do you use it.
1. Do some exercises (Do at least 1 per day. You can determine the total number of exercises. For me, the ideal total would be between 10 to 20)
1. Set up continuous learning. This is to make sure that you retain some knowledge of what you have studied. My suggestions for this are to use SRS (spaced repetition software), regularly do exercises (maybe once or twice a week) or make sure that you are applying what you have learned in your projects.

## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

### Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Making your content search-friendly matters because it's how you get more relevant users viewing your content. This is called search engine optimization (SEO), which can result in more interested users coming to your site.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

### Validation

Ignoring the issue of your website pages validation can lead to your website being below W3C standards. As a result, your website will most likely suffer from errors or poor traffic owing to poor formatting and readability.
