# Web dev things to learn

List of topics that I think are important for web developers to learn. Please note that this is not designed to be a learning course and you will have to try to learn these things on your own or find platforms that offer courses for this. Nonetheless, I have added some links that will help you get started on learning. There is also no particular order for learning the topics so feel free to study the ones that interest you.

To study a topic effectively, I think you need to do the following for a particular topic:

1. Learn the basic definition.
1. Why do you need to learn it?
1. How do you use it?
1. Create a personal project where you can apply your new knowledge.
1. Set up continuous learning. This is to make sure that you retain some knowledge of what you have studied. My suggestions for this are to use SRS (spaced repetition software), regularly do exercises (maybe once or twice a week), or make sure that you are applying what you have learned in your projects.

## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

### Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Making your content search-friendly matters because it's how you get more relevant users viewing your content. This is called search engine optimization (SEO), which can result in more interested users coming to your site.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

### Validation

Ignoring the issue of your website pages validation can lead to your website being below W3C standards. As a result, your website will most likely suffer from errors or poor traffic owing to poor formatting and readability.

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

### Basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

### Box model

Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

### Position static, relative, absolute and fixed

Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.

### Floats

Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages.

### Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

### Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns. It has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

### Animations

CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.
